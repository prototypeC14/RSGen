Assume you are a blockchain expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts via formal verification. 
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Ext {
    uint public x;
    function setX(uint _x) public { x = _x; }
}
contract MyContract {
    function callExt(Ext _e) public {
        _e.setX(42);
        assert(_e.x() == 42);
    }
}

The verifier solcmc identified a assertion failure in this program and generated a counterexample that describes the state and sequence of interactions leading to the property violation. 
The counterexample is provided below:
Counterexample:
Assertion violation happens here.
Counterexample:

_e = 0

Transaction trace:
MyContract.constructor()
MyContract.callExt(0)
    _e.setX(42) -- untrusted external call
    _e.x() -- untrusted external call
  --> original.sol:13:9:
   |
13 |         assert(_e.x() == 42);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the identified vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls. 
The requirements are:
1. Be creative in implementing realistic interaction patterns or adversarial logic to exploit the vulnerability, while ensuring the contract remains focused on reproducing the issue.
2. The generated contract should:
- Be compilable without errors or warnings.
- Use the same Solidity version as the source program.
- Include only the functions, variables, and logic necessary to trigger the vulnerability.
- No explanations, comments, or justifications for the generated code are required.
- Ensure the contract includes any setup logic needed for deployment and interaction with the source program.

Generate the reproduction contract.
