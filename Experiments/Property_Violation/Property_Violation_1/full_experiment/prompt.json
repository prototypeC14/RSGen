Assume you are a blockchain expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts via formal verification. 
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract _MAIN_ {
    uint public a;
    uint public b;

    function set() public {
        a = 3;
        b = 0;
    }

    function check() public {
        uint _a = 0;
        set();
        _a = this.a();

        assert(_a == 3);

        assert(_a == 4);
    }
}

The verifier <tool> identified a property violation in this program and generated a counterexample that describes the state and sequence of interactions leading to the property violation. 
The counterexample is provided below: <counterexample text>.
Counterexample:
Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
  --> original.sol:22:9:
   |
22 |         assert(_a == 4);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the identified vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls. 
The requirements are:
1. Be creative in implementing realistic interaction patterns or adversarial logic to exploit the vulnerability, while ensuring the contract remains focused on reproducing the issue.

2. The generated contract should:
- Be compilable without errors or warnings.
- Use the same Solidity version as the source program.
- Include only the functions, variables, and logic necessary to trigger the vulnerability.
- No explanations, comments, or justifications for the generated code are required.
- Ensure the contract includes any setup logic needed for deployment and interaction with the source program.
