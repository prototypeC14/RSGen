Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Bank {
    uint public a;
    uint public b;

    constructor () public {
        a = 3;
        b = 0;
    }
    function transfer(uint _a, uint _b) public returns(uint) {
        return _a + _b;
    }
Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.
