Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
 //https://github.com/sigp/solidity-security-blog
 pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

 contract Token {

   mapping(address => uint) balances;
   uint public totalSupply;

   constructor(uint _initialSupply) {
     balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
   }

   function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
     // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
     require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
     // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
     balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
     balances[_to] += _value;
     return true;
   }

   function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint balance) {
     return balances[_owner];
   }
 }
Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.
