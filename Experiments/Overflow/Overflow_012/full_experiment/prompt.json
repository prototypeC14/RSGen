Assume you are a blockchain expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts via formal verification. 
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Bank {
    uint public a;
    uint public b;

    constructor () public {
        a = 3;
        b = 0;
    }
    function transfer(uint _a, uint _b) public returns(uint) {
        return _a + _b;
    }
}

The verifier <tool> identified a Overflow in this program and generated a counterexample that describes the state and sequence of interactions leading to the property violation. 
The counterexample is provided below: <counterexample text>.
Counterexample:
a = 3, b = 0
_a = 1
_b = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
 = 0

Transaction trace:
Bank.constructor()
State: a = 3, b = 0
Bank.transfer(1, 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935)
  --> example.sol:14:16:
   |
14 |         return _a + _b;
   |   
Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the identified vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls. 
The requirements are:
1. Be creative in implementing realistic interaction patterns or adversarial logic to exploit the vulnerability, while ensuring the contract remains focused on reproducing the issue.

2. The generated contract should:
- Be compilable without errors or warnings.
- Use the same Solidity version as the source program.
- Include only the functions, variables, and logic necessary to trigger the vulnerability.
- No explanations, comments, or justifications for the generated code are required.
- Ensure the contract includes any setup logic needed for deployment and interaction with the source program.

Generate the reproduction contract.
