Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
//https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/docs/SWC-101#overflow-simple-addsol
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract Overflow_Add {
    uint public balance = 1;

    function add(uint256 deposit) public {
        // <yes> <report> ARITHMETIC
        balance += deposit;
    }
}

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls.
Generate the reproduction contract without any comments.
