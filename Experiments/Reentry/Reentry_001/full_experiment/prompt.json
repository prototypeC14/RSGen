Assume you are a blockchain expert specializing in analyzing vulnerabilities in smart contracts via formal verification. 
Below is the source code of a Solidity program that has been proven to be vulnerable: 
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Bank {
    mapping (address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0);
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success);
    }
    function invariant(uint choice, uint u1, address a) public payable {
        uint currb = balances[a];
        if (choice == 0) {
            deposit();
        } else if (choice == 1) {
            withdraw(u1);
        } else {
            require(false);
        }
        uint newb = balances[a];

        require(newb < currb);
        assert(choice == 1);
        assert(msg.sender == a);
}
}

The verifier <tool> identified a assertion failure in this program and generated a counterexample that describes the state and sequence of interactions leading to the property violation. 
The counterexample is provided below: <counterexample text>.
Counterexample:
Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
Counterexample:
Assertion violation might happen here.

Your task is to generate a reproduction smart contract that can re-trigger the identified vulnerability by interacting with the source program via a series of function calls. 
The requirements are:
1. Be creative in implementing realistic interaction patterns or adversarial logic to exploit the vulnerability, while ensuring the contract remains focused on reproducing the issue.

2. The generated contract should:
- Be compilable without errors or warnings.
- Use the same Solidity version as the source program.
- Include only the functions, variables, and logic necessary to trigger the vulnerability.
- No explanations, comments, or justifications for the generated code are required.
- Ensure the contract includes any setup logic needed for deployment and interaction with the source program.

Generate the reproduction contract.
